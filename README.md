# Java-21 SpringBoot Reference for RESTful API

This project serves as a reference implementation for building well organized, scalable, and maintainable RESTful API's in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  It follows SpringBoot best practice for separation of concerns and leverages OpenTelemetry and Reseliency4j to make the API's supportable and fault-tolerant.  

### Project Organization:

The project package structure is organized around the resources being served by the API.  This lays out the packages as follows:

- com.wfld.*DOMAIN*.*APP_NAME*
  |_> *RESOURCE*
    |_> controllers
    |_> entities
    |_> repositories
    |_> services
  |_> config
